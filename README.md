# Movie-Data-Project  Pivot Tables Design
You are a data analyst working with a filmmaking company. The company is trying to identify what genre of film they should make next.
 In order to help them make this decision, your manager has asked you to answer the following questions: 

On average, how much money do movies make in each genre?

On average, how much money is spent on a movie broken by genre?

On average, which genre has the most profitable movies?

Pivot tables make answering these types of questions much quicker and more accurate when compared to doing these same calculations by hand!
